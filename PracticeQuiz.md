## Answer Key

1. **a)** String str = "Hello";
2. **c)** String (String is a class, not primitive)
3. **b)** 6 6 (++x increments x before assignment)
4. **b)** final
5. **a)** for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
6. **b)** main()
7. **c)** Throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
8. **d)** All of the above
9. **b)** == compares references, .equals() compares content
10. **d)** default (package-private)

## Study Tips for Your Assessment

**Key Areas to Focus On:**

* Basic syntax and data types
* Object-oriented programming concepts (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism)
* Exception handling
* Collections framework
* String manipulation
* Array operations
* Control structures (loops, conditionals)
* Method overloading vs. overriding
* Static vs. instance members

**Time Management:**

* With 2 hours for the assessment, spend about 4-5 minutes per question maximum
* Skip difficult questions initially and return to them
* Read questions carefully - MCQs can have tricky wording
