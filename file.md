Got it! Here is the entire raw markdown snippet in **one single code block** exactly as you can paste into your `.md` file:

````markdown
**8. What will be the output of the following code?**  
```java
System.out.println(10 + 20 + "30");
````

a) 3030
b) 102030
c) 3030
d) 3030

```

Just copy everything inside this code block, including the triple backticks and markdown syntax, as-is.
```
